## Timing Methods
IGT is stored in Game Time, and RTA-TB is stored in "Real Time" for Sonic 1, 2, CD, and 2 (8-bit).  
IGT is stored in Game Time for 3D Blast.
RTA-TB is stored in Game Time for Sonic 1 (SMS), and Sonic 3 & Knuckles, with the option of storing it in Real Time.
RTA is also stored in Game Time for all other games.

## Splits
Most splits are done at the beginning of the next level (i.e. after bonus screens etc) This is with the exception of Sonic Spinball
where splits are done at the final hit on each boss, and at the start of a new level.

Final split is done according to the SRC rules for the relevant game at the time of coding.
Sonic 2 (8 bit) starts the timer just before the Underground 1 splash screen appears, and final split is on fade out (in either SE3 or CE3).

## Debugging options
### Level Select Activation
To help test the autosplitter it has a Debug setting to enable Level Select in games that have one.
### Forcing All Emeralds (Sonic 2 8-bit)
As there are extra levels for collecting all emeralds in this game, and the count is reset when the game is, there is an option to have the correct emerald counts for the Silver Sonic boss, and Crystal Egg Act 3 to play the good ending.
