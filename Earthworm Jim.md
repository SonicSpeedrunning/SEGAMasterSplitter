# Earthworm Jim info

The time starts immediately after pressing any button while selecting the "Press start" in the main menu.
The regular splits are made on the screen where Jim says "Groovy!" after each level.
The final split is done immediately after performing the last hit on Queen (when she's starting blowing up) in Buttville.

Some optional things can also be configured in settings:

- split after Andy Asteroids (or Psycrow) levels (*)
- split while entering the Evil the Cat's lair in What the Heck
- split after the 1st and the 2nd fights with Major Mucus in Snot a problem
- split before the 2nd fight with Chicken Boss in Level 5 (when you need to shoot it while falling)
- split after finishing the "helicopter" section in Buttville
- reset on SEGA logo (*)
- reset while entering the cheat menu (*)

(Options that are marked with an asterisk (*) are enabled by default)
